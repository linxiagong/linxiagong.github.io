As an AI researcher, I was interested in the application of RL in solving complex optimization problems and tried to figure out if there is any possible work that I can contribute. Through my survey, I gained somehow an understanding of the state-of-the-art in this field. Although I eventually shifted my focus to other areas, I hereby would like to share my insights and possibly facilitate future research.</description></item></channel></rss>

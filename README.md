# About Me
I am R&D engineer in the user profiling group in NetEase Fuxi AI Lab, Hangzhou, China since 2017.
I am currently the PI of matchmaking research and projects delivery, and I am the co-investigator in the player modeling and behavior tracing projects.

I received the MA.Sc. degree from Telecom ParisTech in 2017, and the B.S. degree in control science and engineering from Zhejiang University in 2015.

<b>My research interests</b> include data mining and machine learning covering matchmaking, player ranking, behavior modeling, social influence, temporal modeling, etc.
        
### My Credits
&emsp;I focused on frontier research and technology transformation in online games and my work has been successfully applied to a number of important games in NetEase, such as Influx basketball, Justice PC, Ghosts PC, Ghosts Mobile, UNO, etc.
